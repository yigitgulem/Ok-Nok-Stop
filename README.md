# Hand Gesture Recognition for Machine Control

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a robust solution for controlling machines using hand gestures. By recognizing simple hand gestures like 'ok', 'no', and 'stop', we can send corresponding commands to any machine integrated with this system. This approach can be particularly useful in scenarios where physical contact needs to be minimized or where an extra layer of convenience is desired.
